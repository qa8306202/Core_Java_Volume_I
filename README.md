* Chapter 5     【FINISHED】
* Chapter 6     【DOING】

## Chapter 4 Object And Class
* I want to each chapter own one package and one txt file,but because of Java beginner am I,the code and notebook of this chapter looks messy.By default,Chapter 4 package's name is **company** and notebook's name is **ObjAndClass.txt** which is located in note directory.

## Chapter 5 Inheritance
* In this chapter,I divided into 5 sections and each *Test file have an main function,which behavior an examples.

## Chapter 6 Interface,Lambda Expression and Inner Classes
* In this chapter,the sections is the same.The content is so hard to me,so I haven't completely understood "lambda", "inn class" and "proxy".I'll be back!
* in the package,I add my own test program ,which is named ssozh.It uses to understand knowledge point in that section.

**Because I want to accelerate my plant,I decided to skip charpter 7,8.I'll back when I finish chapter 9.**

## Chapter 9 Collection
**In this chapter I want to combine this book with *Introduction to Algorithm*. So this chapter is the fundamental of algorithm.I will continues my data structures learning in another project.**
